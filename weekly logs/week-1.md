# Weekly Internship Log
This log tracks my daily progress and activities during the Electronics Internship.

## Week 1
### Day 1: 26/01/2026

* **Activities:** Learned the basic code for Arduino, tested the KY-011 2-Color LED Module with Arduino Uno (Joy-IT R3 DIP). Tried two different codes with the module and learned the basics of the code used for Arduino. Documented the hardware setup and pin connections.

* **Technical Skills Acquired:**

Installed the Arduino IDE and configured the necessary drivers for the microcontroller to be recognized by the OS.

Learned the difference between Digital Output (used for the LED) and Digital Input, and how the Arduino handles simple HIGH/LOW signals.

Understood the difference between digital and ground pins and how to read a sensor module's pinout (GND(-), R, G, S).

* **Observations:** 

Observed how the dual-color LED can switch between colors by activating different pins.

Realized that the code runs in a continuous loop; once the "Upload" is successful, the Arduino executes the instructions immediately and repeatedly.

Identified that while standard digital pins are sufficient for binary states, PWM pins can be utilized to simulate analog output for tasks requiring variable intensity.



### Day 2: 27/01/2026

* **Activities:** Focused on working with the KY-013 Temperature Sensor to monitor ambient heat changes. The goal was not just to read data, but to use that data to trigger a specific system response.

* **Technical Skills Acquired:**

Learned the difference between Digital Input/Output and Analog Output.

Understood how the Arduino processes variable voltage from a thermistor into a 10-bit digital range (0-1023).

Learned how to define "normal" vs. "critical" data ranges by analyzing real-time sensor output through the Serial Monitor.

* **Observations:** 

Noticed that the sensor reacts very quickly. Even touching it for a second changes the numbers on the screen immediately.

The 0 to 1023 range is very detailed. Makes it easy to pick a specific number to trigger the LED alert.

When trying to read the data too fast, the numbers jumped around. Adding a small delay made the readings much more stable.



### Day 3: 28/01/2026

* **Activities:** 

* **Challanges:**

* **Observations:** 





### Day 4: (29/01/2026)

* **Activities:** Created the official GitHub repository for the internship. Installed and learned the basic GitHub Desktop workflow (Clone, Commit, Push). Created the needed folders, Converted all previously written reports to markdown versions and pushed them to Github.

* **Technical Skills Acquired:** 

Learned how to use GitHub and how to interact with it as I need.

Learned what "Markdown" or ".md" texts are and how to write them.


* **Observations:**
